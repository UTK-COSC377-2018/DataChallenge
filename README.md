# SMC18 ORNL Data Challenge

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/UTK-COSC377-2018/DataChallenge/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/UTK-COSC377-2018/DataChallenge?branch=master)

This repo is for the code for the Data Challenge submission for the Summer 2018 COSC 377 class at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

This code represents our work on and solution for the Data Challenge's [challenge 4](https://smc-datachallenge.ornl.gov/challenge-4-2018/).

All of the core Python code should go in the `DataChallenge` directory. All tests associated with that code should go in the `tests` directory.
